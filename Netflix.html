                The Netflix Kids experience is included in your membership to give parents 
                control while kids enjoy family-friendly TV shows and movies in their
                 own space.

                Kids profiles come with PIN-protected parental controls that let you restrict
                 the maturity rating of content kids can watch and block specific titles you don’t want kids to see.
